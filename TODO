TODO:

- ExperimentHub() filter on biocVersion <= data =< datedataremoved
  (different from AnnotationHub which just does not list a resource
  if datedataremoved is not null)
- add publication metadata field
- how to handle updates: versions vs bugs
- role of md5sums
- policy for keeping old versions around
- should packages build and check on regular basis
