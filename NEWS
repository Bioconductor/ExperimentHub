CHANGES IN VERSION 1.99.0
-------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

    o (1.99.0) The default caching location has changed. Instead of
    rappdirs::user_cache_dir using tools::R_user_dir. To avoid conflicting
    caches, a user will have to manage an old cache location before
    proceeding. Information for handling an old cache location is provided in
    the vignette.
    o (1.99.0) Another major change, a default caching location is automatically
    created in a non interactive session instead of using a temporary
    location. In an interactive session, a user is still prompted for
    permission.

    and refer to single vignette in AnnotationHub

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o (1.13.5) New function removeResources for removing locally downloaded
    cached resources. Nicer interface than using cache. Improved documentation
    on use of setting a cache to NULL to also remove resources.
    o (1.13.4) Adds option ask to constructor. Default: True. Ask will ask user
    to create default ExperimentHub location and if in an non interactive
    session utilize a temporary directory. If False, the default directory is
    created and utilized without prompting.

BUG FIXES

    o (1.13.8) Updated has_internet to nslookup. Certain locations block
    has_internet from running (block google dns). switched so can query the hub
    directly
    o (1.13.7) Fixed messages to be more informative
    o (1.13.2) Aaron's corrections to setExperimentHubOptions.

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o (1.13.1) Match ERROR message when resource not found in database. Instead
    of a generic "unknown key" give more detailed information. This is
    consistent with AnnotationHub/Hub-classes. If resource hasn't been
    completely removed from database, gives when the resource was removed. If
    the resource is available but after the snapshot date being utilized,
    specialized message.

    checking connection. This code pretained to orgDb filters


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.0
------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o (1.9.2) The Hubs have been updated to use BiocFileCache as a backend
    utility for managing and downloading resources. This allows for file
    specific caching mechanism. This change is a significant user change as it
    changed the default directories for the Hubs (AnnotationHub/ExperimentHub)
    as well as the base directory no longer being hidden.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.0

    also use this option automatically if no internet connection is detected.

    o Add new vignette for creating ExperimentHub packages

MODIFICATIONS
